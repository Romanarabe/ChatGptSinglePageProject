        <h1>What is ChatGPT?</h1>
        <p>
          ChatGPT is a natural language processing tool driven by AI technology
          that allows you to have human-like conversations and much more with
          the chatbot. The language model can answer questions and assist you
          with tasks, such as composing emails, essays, and code.

        <h1>How big a deal is ChatGPT?</h1>
        <p>
          "ChatGPT is scary good. We are not far from dangerously strong AI,"
          said Elon Musk, who was one of the founders of OpenAI before leaving.
          Sam Altman, OpenAI's chief,
          <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1599668808285028353" target="_blank"
            >said on Twitter</a
          >
          that ChatGPT had more than one million users in the first five days
          after it launched
        </p>
        <p>
          According to
          <a
            href="https://news.yahoo.com/chatgpt-fastest-growing-app-history-142338104.html?guccounter=1" target="_blank"

            >fastest-growing app of all time.</a
          >
          The analysis estimates that ChatGPT had 100 million active users in
          January, only two months after its launch. For comparison, it took
          nine months for TikTok to reach 100 million users.

        <h1>How can you access ChatGPT?</h1>
        <p>
          You can access ChatGPT simply by visiting
          <a href="chat.openai.com" target="_blank">chat.openai.com</a> and creating an OpenAI
          account.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also still use the old URL for the chatbot, which is
          <a href="https://chat.openai.com/" target="_blank">chat.openai.com/chat.</a> OpenAI
          simplified the original URL for user convenience.
        </p>

          Once you sign in, you can start chatting away with ChatGPT. Get your
          conversation started by asking a question. Because ChatGPT is still in
          its research stage, it is free to use and you can ask as many
          questions as you'd like

        <h1>How much does ChatGPT cost?</h1>
        <p>
          ChatGPT is free to use, regardless of what you use it for including
          writing, coding, and much more.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a subscription option that users can take advantage of that
          costs $20/month. The paid subscription model guarantees users extra
          perks such as general access even at capacity, and faster response
          times./p>
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the free version is still a solid option as it has mostly the
          same technical abilities, with the exception of access to the latest
          version of the AI, known as GPT-4, which the subscription model
          guarantees.
        </p>
        <h1>
          I tried using ChatGPT and it says it's at capacity. What does that
          mean?
        </h1>
        <p>
          ChatGPT is still free to use. Because of the stir its advanced
          capabilities have made, many people are flocking to use it. The
          website operates using a server, and when too many people hop onto the
          server, it overloads and can't process your request. This doesn't mean
          you won't ever be able to access it. It just means you should try
          visiting the site at a later time when fewer people are trying to
          access the server. You can also keep the tab open and just refresh it
          periodically.

          If you want to skip the wait and have reliable access, there is an
          option for you. OpenAI's ChatGPT pro plan, known as

          >
          allows users to have general access even during peak times, experience
          faster response times, and have priority access to new features and
          improvements, including OpenAI's most advanced LLM, GPT-4. The premium
          services cost $20 per month.

        <h1>HOw are people using ChatGPT?</h1>
        <p>
          The model has many functions in addition to answering simple
          questions. ChatGPT can compose essays, describe art in great detail,
          create AI art prompts, have philosophical conversations, and even code

        <h1>What is the difference between ChatGPT and a search engine?</h1>
        <p>
          ChatGPT is a language model created to hold a conversation with the
          end user. A search engine indexes web pages on the internet to help
          the user find the information they asked for. ChatGPT does not have
          the ability to search the internet for information. It uses the
          information it learned from training data to generate a response,
          which leaves room for error.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Also:
          <a
            href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-plans-to-add-ai-tools-to-its-search-engine/" target="_blank"
            >Google plans to add AI tools to its search engine</a
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Another major difference is that ChatGPT only has access to
          information up to 2021, whereas a regular search engine like Google
          has access to the latest information. So if you ask ChatGPT who won
          the World Cup in 2022, it wouldn't be able to give you a response, but
          Google would.
        </p>
        <h1>What are ChatGPT's limitations?</h1>
        <p>
          Despite looking very impressive, ChatGPT still has limitations. Such
          limitations include the inability to answer questions that are worded
          in a specific way, as it requires rewording to understand the input
          question. A bigger limitation is a lack of quality in the responses it
          delivers -- which can sometimes be plausible-sounding but make no
          practical sense or can be excessively verbose.
        </p>
        <h1>Can I chat with ChatGPT?</h1>
        <p>
          Although some people are using ChatGPT for some elaborate functions,
          such as writing code or
          <a
            href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/people-are-already-trying-to-get-chatgpt-to-write-malware/" target="_blank"
            >even malware,</a
          >
          you can use ChatGPT for more mundane activities like having a friendly
          conversation.
        </p>
        <h1>Why are some people worried about ChatGPT?</h1>
        <p>
          People are expressing concerns about AI chatbots replacing or
          atrophying human intelligence. For example, the chatbot can write an
          article on any topic efficiently (though not necessarily accurately)
          within seconds, potentially eliminating the need for a human writer.
